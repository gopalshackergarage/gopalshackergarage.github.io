Decent at Math and loves Physics, a right-brainer who loves being creative and that ended-him-up choosing 'Programming' as his day-job. He loves what he does.

Started as an Android Developer and he switched to server-side as a Full-Stack Developer (Java for Backend, React Js for Frontend). Wearing multiple hats, aided him to perceive Patterns, Solutions and Trade-offs.

He believes Expressive Code is fun and profitable, which enthused him towards Functional Programming. He's language geek, currently dabbling with other JVM languages like Kotlin and Scala, lifting their goodies into his daily Java programming.

He loves being on Stage, as a Singer(http://bit.ly/agssc) and a Tech-Speaker and blogs about [Nature](leafOnTheWind.ga) (http://leafOnTheWind.ga) and [Life](http://bit.ly/agsmdm) (http://bit.ly/agsmdm)
