But let us say, we need to perform an operation to calculate age of every person based on their DOB, OOP tells us to keep that as a function inside <strong>Person</strong> class. But if you as FP, it looks at it like a mathematical data-driven operation. It suggests you to prepare a function independent of a person class, which can be called with DOB as input, and we get age as output.

In such scenario, design can be changed from OOP to FP, by passing the core function as an argument to constructor and use it for evaluation. This smells <strong>Strategy Pattern</strong>. Before Java 8, we had to use anonymous inner classes to achieve the same.</li>\n<li>Functions can be treated as values, and they can be assigned to variables. These are called <strong>First Class Functions</strong> and this type of programming is called <strong>Higher Order Programming</strong>.

So you can essentially pass the values along with their formula to the function, and function uses the formula passed to evaluate like above. This way we can abstract the formula and the values passed.</li>\n<li>Like Encapsulation in OOP, FP's mantra is <strong>Isolation</strong>, that is running functions without any knowledge of the outside world.</li>\n<li>In FP thinking, <strong>Evaluation over Execution</strong> is preferred. Evaluation is mostly constructed with DIDO (Data-in Data-out) functions, which take data in, process and return an output, without causing side effects. This should form the Core of the application. This is wrapped up with Execution elements like UI, DB, File IO etc. Functional part should only focus on evaluation and computing output from input.</li>\n<li>Make functions generic whenever possible.</li>\n<li>Java 8 recognizes and treats static functions, that don't need instance instantiation, as constants. This way it doesn't have to create instance every time the method is called.</li>\n<li>When looping through a list and implementing multiple operations on it, the code inside the loop clubs logic for all those operations. Instead it would be clean if we can separate those operations into different functions, which leads to <strong>Separation of Concerns</strong>.</li>\n<li>In non-java8 environments, when using anonymous classes in-place of lambdas, try putting them outside as static constants of Function type or equivalent, and pass into Stream operations.</li>\n<li>To perform multiple operations on same list of elements, link them like <strong>Pipeline</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"Streams\" style=\"position:relative;\">Streams<a href=\"#Streams\" aria-label=\"Streams permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>List elements are passed one after the other and one at a time, through all the stream operations.</li>\n<li>None of the stream operations gets triggered, until a Terminal operation (Like reduce), is called.

Note, you still need to check <code>isPresent()</code>, so it's not a total replacement to avoid checking, it just makes it error free. According to the documentation, Optional should be used as a return type. And thatâs all. It's a neat solution for handling data that might be not present.</li>\n<li>Also, It can be flawlessly used in the stream chains, without worrying about Null. It can also be used to return alternate results with <code>orElse</code> when the result set is empty.</li>\n<li>Stream, Optional and Functions are <strong>Contexts</strong>.
