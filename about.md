## About the Author
-------
Gopal, Senior Software Developer (SDE 3) at Oracle IDC, Hyderabad.

Decent at Maths and loves Physics, a right-brainer who loves being imaginative and that ended-him-up choosing ‘Programming’ as his day-job. He loves what he does.

Started as a Java Developer in web apps, he has been inquisitive in taking-up new opportunities that presented a chance to try something new. He rolled into the roles of Cloud App Developer, Android App Developer, Android Framework Developer, Backend Server Engineer and React Js Developer. Wearing multiple hats as a part of his 5 years career, aided him to perceive the Abstraction between Art of Coding and Domain-specific Technologies, so as to brew them in different pots, as a Language-Agnostic Developer.

He loves being on Stage, as a Singer, Speaker and Anchor. An Ambivert, who enjoys quality Solitude as well as meeting new people. Fond of reading about Astronomy, Philosophy and Sci-fi. An avid Movie-buff and wishes to be a Screen-Writer someday :)
