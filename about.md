My Hacker blog, where I would like to share my learnings and digitize the notes I make, to make them helpful for other developers :)
<!--TODO: Improve About me, including your tech skills and other stuff. -->

### About the Author
Gopal, Senior Software Developer (SDE 3) at Oracle IDC, Hyderabad.

An Electronics & Communications Engineer by degree, poor at Maths and good at Physics, a right-brainer who loves being imaginative and that ended-him-up choosing ‘Programming’ as his day-job and loves what he does.

Started as a Java Developer in web apps, he has been inquisitive in taking-up new opportunities that presented a chance to try something new. He rolled into the roles of Cloud App Developer, Android App Developer, Android Framework Developer, Backend Server Engineer and React Js Developer. Wearing multiple hats as a part of his 5 years career, aided him to perceive the Abstraction between Art of Coding and Domain-specific Technologies, so as to brew them in different pots, as a Language-Agnostic Developer.

He loves being on Stage, as a Singer, Speaker and Anchor. An Ambivert, who enjoys quality Solitude as well as meeting new people. Fond of reading about Astronomy, Philosophy and Sci-fi. An avid Movie-buff and wishes to be a Screen-Writer someday :)
